For prepare wsdl schema need exec: mvn compile
 from ./wsdl
After this copy ./wsdl/spb to ./service/src/main/java

For running service and client need exec spring boot applications:
1) service/src/main/java/spb/iac/calc/service/ServiceAplication.java
2) client/src/main/java/spb/iac/calc/client/ClientAplication.java
from ide (or compile jars with executable = true property)

Service start on default port 8080
Client start on port 8081 of tomcat

For download wsdl send GET http://localhost:8080/ws/service.wsdl

If send GET http://localhost:port/api/calc/?a=3&b=4&c=1
 when client send SOAP request to service. Service return SOAP request to client.
 client return json result.
